Q-4 What is a static site? Explain in your own words.
Ans-Here iss an explanation of a static site in points:
    1)  A static site is a website that is composed of HTML, CSS, and other files that are stored on a web server and sent to your web browser when you request them.
    2)  Unlike dynamic sites, which generate content on the fly using server-side scripting languages and databases, static sites are pre-built and don't require any server-side processing.
    3)  This means that static sites are faster and more lightweight than dynamic sites, as they don't require as much processing power or database access.
    4)  Static sites are also more secure than dynamic sites, as they don't allow for the execution of server-side code that could be vulnerable to attacks.
    5)  Examples of static sites include blogs, portfolios, and company websites that don't require frequent updates or user interactions.
    6)  Static sites are typically hosted on a web server or a content delivery network (CDN) and can be deployed using tools like Git or FTP.
    7)  Because static sites don't require server-side processing, they are often cheaper and easier to host than dynamic sites, which can require more resources and maintenance.
    Overall, a static site is a simple and efficient way to create a website that doesn't require complex server-side processing or database access, making them a popular choice for small to medium-sized websites.
    
Q-5 What is a dynamic site? Explain in your own words.
Ans-Here is an explanation of a dynamic site in points:
    1)  A dynamic site is a website that generates content on the fly, using server-side scripting languages and databases to create web pages that can change based on user input or other factors.
    2)  Unlike static sites, which are pre-built and don't require any server-side processing, dynamic sites use server-side code to generate content and respond to user actions.
    3)  Examples of dynamic sites include social networks, e-commerce sites, and web applications that require real-time data and user interactions.
    4)  Dynamic sites are often built using server-side scripting languages like PHP, Python, or Ruby, which allow developers to generate content based on user input, database queries, or other factors.
    5)  Dynamic sites also typically use databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL to store and retrieve data, allowing for more complex interactions and functionality.
    6)  Dynamic sites can be more complex and resource-intensive than static sites, requiring more powerful servers and more maintenance and updates.
    7)  Because dynamic sites generate content on the fly, they can be more personalized and responsive to user actions, making them ideal for sites that require real-time updates or complex interactions.
    8)  Dynamic sites are also more vulnerable to security threats and require more careful maintenance and updates to ensure that they remain secure.
    Overall, a dynamic site is a powerful and flexible way to create a website that can respond to user input and provide complex functionality, but requires more resources and maintenance than a simple static site.
