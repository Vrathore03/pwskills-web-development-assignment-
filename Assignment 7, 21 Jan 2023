Q-1 What are inline and block elements in HTML and the difference between them? Name a few inline elements and block elements.
Ans- Block elements: Block elements are those HTML elements that take up the full width available to them and create a line break after the element. Examples of 
                     block-level elements include headings (h1, h2, etc.), paragraphs (p), divs, lists (ul, ol), and sections (section, article, nav, aside, etc.). Block 
                     elements are often used to structure and layout web pages.

Inline elements: Inline elements are those HTML elements that occupy only the necessary space to display their content and do not create a line break after the element. 
                 Examples of inline elements include links (a), images (img), span, strong, em, and input. Inline elements are often used to add additional formatting 
                 and styles to text within block-level elements.
                 
Here are some key differences between inline and block elements in HTML:
   1) Block elements take up the full width available to them, while inline elements only take up the necessary space to display their content.
   2) Block elements create a line break before and after the element, while inline elements do not create a line break after the element.
   3) Block elements are often used to structure and layout web pages, while inline elements are often used to add additional formatting and styles to text within 
      block-level elements.
   4) Block elements are typically used to create large sections of content on a web page, while inline elements are used to add small, specific formatting effects to 
      content.
      
Q-2 How to work with images in HTML and explain in detail <img/> tag important attributes.
Ans- Working with images in HTML involves the '<img>' tag to display images on a web page. Here's the way of how to do it:

       1) Find or create an image: First, you need to find or create an image that you want to display on your web page.
       2) Upload the image: Next, you need to upload the image file to your website's server so that it can be accessed by your web page.
       3) Insert the image using the <img> tag: To display the image on your web page, you need to use the '<img>' tag. Here's an example:

     <img src="path/to/image.jpg" alt="Description of the image">

   The '<img>' tag has some important attributes that you can use to control how the image is displayed on your web page:

       1) 'src': This specifies the path to the image file.
       2) 'alt': This provides a text description of the image for people who cannot see it.
       3) 'width' and 'height': These control the size of the image.
       4) 'title': This provides additional information about the image when the user hovers over it with their mouse.
       5) 'class' and 'id': These allow you to add CSS styling to the image.
 By using these attributes, you can control how your image is displayed on your web page and provide additional information about the image for users who cannot see it.
 
Q-3 How to create lists in HTML?
Ans- In HTML, you can create three types of lists: ordered lists, unordered lists, and definition lists. Here's how to create each of them:

        1) Ordered Lists: Ordered lists are used when you want to display a numbered list of items. To create an ordered list, use the <ol> tag and add each list item 
                          with the <li> tag. Here's an example:
                                                                    <ol>
                                                                        <li>First item</li>
                                                                        <li>Second item</li>
                                                                        <li>Third item</li>
                                                                   </ol>
       2) Unordered Lists: Unordered lists are used when you want to display a bulleted list of items. To create an unordered list, use the <ul> tag and add each list 
                           item with the <li> tag. Here's an example:
                                                                    <ul>
                                                                        <li>First item</li>
                                                                        <li>Second item</li>
                                                                        <li>Third item</li>
                                                                   </ul>
       3) Definition Lists: Definition lists are used when you want to display a list of terms and their definitions. To create a definition list, use the <dl> tag 
                            and add each term with the <dt> tag and its corresponding definition with the <dd> tag. Here's an example:
                                                                   <dl>
                                                                        <dt>Term 1</dt>
                                                                        <dd>Definition 1</dd>
                                                                        <dt>Term 2</dt>
                                                                        <dd>Definition 2</dd>
                                                                        <dt>Term 3</dt>
                                                                        <dd>Definition 3</dd>
                                                                   </dl>
        By using these tags, you can create lists of items on your web page in an organized and structured manner.
