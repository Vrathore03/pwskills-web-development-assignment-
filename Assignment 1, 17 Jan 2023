Q-3 Why did JavaScript come into the picture?
Ans- Here are some key points about why JavaScript came into the picture:
       1) Prior to the emergence of JavaScript, web pages were mostly static documents that displayed information without any user interaction.
       2) JavaScript was introduced to add interactivity and dynamic functionality to web pages.
       3) JavaScript is a scripting language that runs on the client-side, meaning that it is executed by the user's web browser rather than a server.
       4) JavaScript allows web developers to create interactive elements like pop-ups, drop-down menus, image sliders, and more.
       5) JavaScript can respond to user actions, such as mouse clicks and keystrokes, to create dynamic and interactive web pages.
       6) JavaScript has continued to evolve and expand its capabilities, allowing web developers to create more complex and sophisticated applications.
       7) Today, JavaScript is used to build everything from simple website animations to complex web applications and even mobile and desktop applications.
       
Q-4 History of JavaScript and EcmaScript. Explain in your own words.
Ans- Here are some key points about the history of JavaScript and ECMAScript:
       1) JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 while he was working at Netscape Communications Corporation. The original name for JavaScript was Mocha, then 
          it was renamed to LiveScript, and finally to JavaScript to capitalize on the popularity of Java at the time.
       2) JavaScript was created to add interactivity and dynamic functionality to web pages.
       3) In 1996, Netscape submitted JavaScript to the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA) to standardize the language. The standardization process 
          resulted in ECMAScript, which is the official name that defines how JavaScript should work.
       4) ECMAScript 1 was released in 1997, followed by ECMAScript 2 in 1998 and ECMAScript 3 in 1999.
       5) ECMAScript 4 was abandoned in 2008, and its features were eventually added to later versions of ECMAScript.
       6) ECMAScript 5 was released in 2009, and ECMAScript 6 (ES6) was released in 2015, introducing major new features.
       7) New versions of ECMAScript have been released every year since then, with the latest being ECMAScript 2022.
    In summary, JavaScript was created to add interactivity and dynamic functionality to web pages, and ECMAScript is the official name for the language specification
    that defines how JavaScript should work. ECMAScript has gone through several versions, each adding new features and improvements to the language.
