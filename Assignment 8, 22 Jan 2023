Q-2 Explain all Media elements and how they work.
Ans- Following are the media elements in HTML:

        1) '<img>': This media element is used to embed images into a web page.
                  It requires a "src" attribute that specifies the image file location.
                  Additional attributes can be used to specify the image dimensions, alt text, and more.
                  Example: '<img src="image.jpg" alt="A beautiful landscape" width="500" height="300">'

                    It requires a "src" attribute that specifies the audio file location.
                    Additional attributes can be used to specify the audio controls, autoplay, loop, and more.
                    Example: '<audio src="audio.mp3" controls autoplay></audio>'
                    
        3) '<video>': This media element is used to embed video files into a web page.
                    It requires a "src" attribute that specifies the video file location.
                    Additional attributes can be used to specify the video dimensions, controls, autoplay, loop, and more.
                    Example: '<video src="video.mp4" width="640" height="360" controls autoplay></video>'
                    
Q-3 What is Get and Post in Form?
Ans- Here's a explanation of the 'GET' and 'POST' methods in HTML forms:

      1) 'GET' Method:
                  Sends form data through the URL in the web address bar.
                  Used for simple requests, like searching or visiting a new page.
                  Data is visible in the URL, making it easy to share.
                  Can only send a limited amount of data (usually up to 2048 characters).
                  Not secure for sending sensitive information, like passwords.
                  
      2) 'POST' Method:

                  Sends form data through the server request body
                  Used for complex requests, like submitting a form with a lot of data or updating data on a server
                  Data is not visible in the URL, making it harder to share
                  Can send a large amount of data
                  More secure for sending sensitive information than the 'GET' method
      In HTML, you can specify the method used to submit form data by setting the "method" attribute on the '<form>' element, like this:

         <form method="get" action="/search">                                                            <form method="post" action="/signup">
           <!-- form fields -->                                                                            <!-- form fields -->
           <button type="submit">Search</button>                                                           <button type="submit">Sign up</button>
         </form>                                                                                         </form>
