Q-1 What are the new things introduced in HTML5?
Ans- HTML5 introduced several new features that made it easier for developers to create dynamic and interactive web pages. Some of them include:
       1) Semantic elements that help structure web pages in a more meaningful way.
       2) New form input types and attributes that simplify form handling and validation.
       3) Built-in support for playing audio and video without the need for external plugins.
       4) The <canvas> element that allows developers to create animations and graphics using JavaScript.
       5) Local storage APIs that let websites store data on a user's device for offline use.
       6) The Geolocation API that allows websites to access a user's location data.
       7) The <picture> element that provides a simple way to serve images for different screen sizes and resolutions.
       8) Web workers that enable JavaScript to run in the background without blocking the main thread.
       9) Web sockets that allow for real-time communication between a client and server.
       
Q-2 What are semantic tags? Give a couple of examples.
Ans- Semantic tags are HTML elements that describe the content within them, rather than just defining how they should look. They help provide meaning and structure to 
     web pages, which can improve accessibility, search engine optimization, and overall readability. Some examples of semantic tags in HTML5 include:

       1) <header> - used to define a header section of a web page.
       2) <nav> - used to define a section of navigation links.
       3) <article> - used to define a self-contained article or blog post.
       4) <section> - used to define a section of related content.
       5) <aside> - used to define content that is related but separate from the main content.
       6) <footer> - used to define a footer section of a web page.
       7) <main> - used to define the main content of a web page.
       8) <figure> - used to define a self-contained content, such as an image, video, or diagram.
       9) <figcaption> - used to define the caption or description for a <figure> element. 
    By using semantic tags, developers can create web pages that are more accessible, easier to understand, and better optimized for search engines.
    
Q-3 List some uses of semantic tags.
Ans- Semantic tags in HTML have the following uses:
        1) They make web pages more accessible to people with disabilities by providing a more structured and meaningful content.
        2) They help search engines understand the content and structure of a web page, which can improve its ranking in search results.
        3) They make the HTML code more readable and easier to maintain.
        4) They make it easier to apply styles with CSS.
        5) They ensure consistency across different pages and websites.
        6) They help developers to organize and structure web page content in a way that is easier to maintain and update over time.
    Overall, the use of semantic tags can help improve the quality, usability, and accessibility of web pages, as well as their search engine rankings.
