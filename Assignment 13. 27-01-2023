Q-1   Why is it called a psedo-class?
Ans-  1.  "Pseudo" means something that is not genuine or not exactly what it appears to be.
      2.  "Class" refers to the class attribute in HTML, which is used to apply styles to elements with a specific class name.

    A pseudo-class is used to target and style elements in specific states or conditions, such as when they are being hovered over, clicked, or in a particular position within the document 
    (e.g., first child, last child, etc.).

    For example, the ':hover' pseudo-class is used to apply styles to an element when the user hovers over it with their mouse. Since the hover state is not a distinct class defined in the HTML, it 
    is called a pseudo-class.

    Here's an example of how a pseudo-class is used in CSS:

      css
           /* Styles the link when the user hovers over it */
           a:hover {
              color: blue;
           }
   In this case, the :hover pseudo-class is applied to the anchor (a) element, and when the user hovers over the link, the text color changes to blue.

Q-2   What are gradients in CSS?
Ans-  Gradients in CSS are a way to create smooth transitions between two or more colors. They allow you to apply a gradual blend of colors, creating visually appealing backgrounds or decorative 
      effects on elements. Gradients provide a smoother and more dynamic appearance compared to solid colors.

      There are two main types of gradients in CSS:

          1.  Linear Gradients: Linear gradients create a transition between colors along a straight line. You can control the direction and angle of the gradient. It is defined using the 
                                'linear-gradient()' function.
              Example:
                       .element {
                             background: linear-gradient(to right, red, blue);
                       }
              In this example, the background of the element will have a linear gradient from red on the left to blue on the right.

          2.  Radial Gradients: Radial gradients create a transition between colors radiating outward from a center point. It is defined using the 'radial-gradient()' function.
              Example:
                      .element {
                             background: radial-gradient(circle, yellow, green);
                       }
              In this example, the background of the element will have a radial gradient from yellow at the center to green at the edges.

Q-3   What are different types of transitions in CSS?
Ans-  CSS transitions allow you to change property values smoothly over a given duration. Instead of having property changes take effect immediately, you can cause the changes in a property to take place over a 
      period of time. There are several types of transitions in CSS, which include:
         1.  transition-property: This property specifies which CSS properties to transition. You can use a comma-separated list of property names or the keyword "all" to indicate that every property should 
                                  transition.
         2.  transition-duration: This property specifies the length of time that a transition will take to complete. You can specify the duration in seconds or milliseconds.
         3.  transition-timing-function: This property specifies the speed of the transition. You can use keywords like "linear", "ease", and "ease-in-out", or you can use a cubic-bezier function to create a 
                                         custom timing function.
         4.  transition-delay: This property specifies a delay (in seconds) for the transition effect. You can use this property to create a delay between the time a property is changed and the beginning of the 
                               transition effect.
