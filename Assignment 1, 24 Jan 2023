Q-2 What are the different ways to bring CSS into HTML file?
Ans- Here are the different ways to bring CSS into an HTML file:
         1) External CSS:
                    Create a separate CSS file with the extension .css.
                    Use the <link> tag in the head section of the HTML file with the rel attribute set to "stylesheet" and the href attribute pointing to the CSS file 
                    location.
                    
         2) Internal CSS:
                   Add the <style> tag in the head section of the HTML file.
                   Add CSS rules within the <style> tag.
                   
         3) Inline CSS:
                   Add the style attribute to an HTML element.
                   Add CSS rules directly within the style attribute.
     Overall, external CSS is recommended for larger websites with multiple pages, internal CSS is useful for small websites with only a few pages, and inline CSS is 
     useful for quick, one-off styling changes to specific HTML elements.
     
Q-3 What do you mean by specificity in CSS?
Ans- In CSS, "specificity" is a way to determine which CSS rule should be applied when multiple CSS rules target the same HTML element. Specificity is measured in 
     points, and it's based on the number and types of selectors used in the CSS rule.

     The specificity points are calculated by adding up the following values:

           1) 1 point for each element selector, attribute selector, or pseudo-class selector.
           2) 10 points for each class selector or attribute selector.
           3) 100 points for each ID selector.
           4) 1000 points for each inline style attribute.
    When multiple CSS rules target the same HTML element, the one with the highest specificity points will take precedence and be applied.
